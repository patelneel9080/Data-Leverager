3. Challenges Faced & Solutions


-   Issue: Joining Sales and Employees was not possible on EmployeeID
    (not available in Sales).
    -   Solution: Performed join using Region, ensuring all sales rows
        were kept.
-   Issue: Different data types caused errors in merge and calculations.
    -   Solution: Corrected data types (Whole Number, Decimal, Date)
        before merging.
